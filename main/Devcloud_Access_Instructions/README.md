### Connection Methods

Once you have an account / email received you are ready to start the process to setup our account within the cloud. 

There are different methods of terminal connections. Listed below are a few options you can select in choosing which Terminal application tool you would like to use:

1. [Windows with Mobaxterm (SSH client)](#30-access-from-your-pc-via-mobaxterm-or-from-linux-terminal) (recommended)
2. [Windows with Cygwin](https://devcloud.intel.com/datacenter/learn/connect-with-ssh-windows-cygwin/)
3. [Windows with PuTTy](https://devcloud.intel.com/datacenter/learn/connect-with-ssh-windows/)
4. [Linux or macOS (SSH client)](#30-access-from-your-pc-via-mobaxterm-or-from-linux-terminal)



## 3.0 Access from your PC via MobaXterm or from Linux Terminal

**MobaXterm** is an enhanced terminal for Windows with an X11 server, a tabbed SSH client and several other network tools for remote computing (VNC, RDP, telnet, rlogin). **MobaXterm** brings all the essential Unix commands to Windows desktop, in a single portable exe file which works out of the box and makes your Windows PC look like a UNIX environment. If you are already running a native Linux or client running Linux, you don't need to load MobaXterm. 

### 3.1 Install MobaXterm

1. Download the MobaXterm free edition: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html Note: Get the **installer edition**, not the portable edition. (The installer edition will enable you to save login profiles.) . Download zipfile, open it and click on the msi file to install Mobaxterm.

   ![mobaxterm_edition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715527-3fee6500-f987-11e9-8961-6c0a38163bfc.png)

### 3.2 Open Local Terminal 

1. Launch MobaXterm using the installer. You should see the following:

![mobaxterm_window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715801-c5721500-f987-11e9-95e0-bdf9f76b7f43.png)

2. Click: **"Start local terminal"**. Within this console you can see your local PC based files using standard Linux operating system commands (ls, cd, vi and etc.). 

3. Navigate around with ```cd``` (change directory) and ```ls``` (list) you will recognize your Windows folders and files accessible through a UNIX interface. 

   Return to home by typing: ``` cd ```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69997123-4c2a8c80-1508-11ea-89d0-547a8a40515f.png)

If MobaXterm fails to launch after working for a period of time, try reinstalling the software. Prior to removal and re-install, copy the folder MobaXterm from your Documents directory to a new name. Under the directory Mobaxterm/home you will have the .ssh folder and .bashrc file. Reinstall Mobaxterm and copy these files over to the new install if you have customized these files.

### 3.3 Downloading an SSH key

**For the MobaXterm flow, native LINUX flow or macOS, click on the link Linux or macOS and follow the steps as stated in the welcome email.**

To start the process:

1. Click on the first link in the welcome email (might need to use an incognito window if you have issues launching or clear cookies).
2.  If you are a first time user, you will see a "Terms and Conditions" page come up. Please click "accept" on the T&C's to proceed.
3. You will then come to a new screen asking to select "Learn" or "Connect", please select "Connect".
4. The following page will then be displayed. Click on âLinux* or MAC OSâ under the "Connect with a Terminal" button.

![ssh_key_access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67715899-f3eff000-f987-11e9-9b1c-5ad2ba2a96ea.png)

6. After clicking â**SSH key for Linux/macOS**â, you will get instructions on accessing a UNIX key file. 

7. Click the button "SSH Key for Linux/macOS". 

8. Create the directory ~/. ssh, unless it already exists and move the private SSH key into permanent storage in ~/.ssh:

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   mv ~/Downloads/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt ~/.ssh/
   ```

9. Add the following lines to files ~/.ssh/config:

   ```
   Host devcloud 
   #replace with your own user name
   User u12345
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt
   ProxyCommand ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt guest@devcloud.intel.com
   ```

   If you saved your key in a location other than ~/Downloads/, insert the correct path and the correct user number that was provided to you in the email. 

   10. Set the correct restrictive permissions on the private SSH. Run the following commands in terminal: 

   ```
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/devcloud-access-key-u12345.txt
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
   ```



**The next steps to connect to the Intel Devcloud are different for usage inside and outside the Intel Firewall. Select the correct usage option below:** 

[Public User](#public-user)

[User Inside Intel Firewall](#user-inside-intel-firewall)



## 4.0 Connection to Devcloud

### Public User

After the preparation steps above, you should be able to log in to your login node in the Intel Devcloud without a password. 

1. Enter the following: 

   ```
   ssh devcloud
   ```

Upon the first login, you will be asked to add the host devcloud to the list of known hosts. Answer **yes**.

```
The authenticity of host 'devcloud' (<no hostip for proxy command>)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'devcloud' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
# We are in!
logout
Connection to login-1 closed.
```

Next time you log in, you will only need to type ```ssh devcloud ```

Click [here](#50-Connecting-to-Servers-Running-FPGA-Development-Software) to skip to the next step. 

### User Inside Intel Firewall

You cannot log into the Intel Devcloud if you are within the Intel firewall. This section contains the tunneling commands and MobaXterm modifications needed to bypass the firewall to connect to the Devcloud. 

### 4.1 Add SOcket CAT Package

1. Go to the packages icon and left-click.

   ![packages_icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716101-6234b280-f988-11e9-972a-7c13370e1adc.png)

   Your next step you will see the MobApt package manager for MobaXterm:

   ![socat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716113-6b258400-f988-11e9-828a-83c74b051b91.png)

3. Install the **socat package**. This will take approximately 9 minutes to install.

### 4.2  Preparing Configuration file

1. Append these additional entries into your config file: 

```
Host colfax-intel-proxy
User guest
hostname cluster.colfaxresearch.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt
ProxyCommand socat STDIO SOCKS4:proxy-us.intel.com:%h:%p,socksport=1080

Host colfax-intel-proxy-shell colfax-intel
#replace with your own user name
User u12345 
hostname devcloud
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/devcloud-access-key-12345.txt
ProxyCommand ssh -T colfax-intel-proxy
```

2. At your local machine prompt type: 

```
ssh colfax-intel
```

You will now be logged in:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69987680-e54fa800-14f4-11ea-8b03-9da4de9381c7.png)



## 5.0 Connecting to Servers Running FPGA Development Software

### 5.1 Understanding available resources

You are now logged in to machine called login-l (headnode). You cannot run compute jobs here. You need to run compute jobs on a powerful server.  

The following nodes can run Quartus, OpenCL and HLS: n130-n139.

The following nodes can run OPAE connectivity to PAC Cards: n137-n139.

There are a total of 12 Arria 10 PAC Cards, 4 each on n137, n138 and n139. 

To query if free nodes are available run the below command on the login server (headnode). The terminology that we will use is localnode (your PC), headnode (login node) and computenode. The computenode is a high power machine for running compilations - a subset host PAC cards: n137, n138 and n139. 

```
pbsnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
pbsnodes -l free 	# lists all free nodes (only nodes 130-139 run x2go)
```

You will get a listing of free and busy nodes that connect to PAC cards. 

If there is a free node, when you execute this command you will be logged in to a new machine within a minute or so. If no machine is available, you will be placed in a queue.

To login to a specific machine, execute one of the following commands:

```
qsub -l nodes=s001-n130:ppn=2                         # (for s001-n130 through s001-n136)
qsub -q batch@v-qsvr-fpga -I -l nodes=s001-n137:ppn=2 # (for s001-n137 through s001-n139, and s001-n189)
```
When launching the qsub command, you can request additional memory with the following command. Note: Each job takes 2 slots, so when you request 10G, it's actually 10G*2 = 20GB.
```
-l h_vmem=10G
```

Now you have a high power machine available for powerful computing jobs. You only have a console available but no graphics available. Note: MobaXterm has multiple tabs and three possibilities of where to be logged in: 

- Local Machine (eg. llandis-MOBL)
- devcloud login-l login server
- compute server (eg n137)

Be cognizant of which Mobaxterm tab and machine you are typing in.

At this point you will want to run a PC based product called **X2Go client** that will allow you to have a Linux based GUI Intel Quartus and multiple terminal usage. In order to run GUI based applications such as Quartus and Modelsim, you will need to download an application on your PC called X2Go. X2Go is the remedy for slow graphics response from Mobaxterm running X11 or VNC windowing systems.



## 6.0 Loading and launching X2Go

To download X2Go, navigate to this link on your PC browser: https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start

Grab the **MS Windows version** â click where the cursor is in the screenshot below <u>**(mswin)**</u>:

![launching_x2go](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716221-a6c04e00-f988-11e9-97a6-bae636d8732b.png)

Go through the install steps for the mswin X2Go Client and accept all.

Repoen the MobaXterm window, open a second session tab by clicking on the "+" as shown below:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69987433-5b074400-14f4-11ea-9046-eb3d39ca0f69.png)

This tab will a launch terminal running UNIX commands on your local machine.

### 6.1 Opening Port for Graphics Usage in X2Go

To open the port for graphics usage, enter the command below. Note: Replace the hostname n137 listed below with the machine. 

```
ssh -L 4002:s001-n137:22 devcloud			# Public User Example

ssh -L 4002:s001-n137:22 colfax-intel		# Inside Intel Firewall Example
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69987632-c7824300-14f4-11ea-84c7-682490dc19f8.png)



Launch the x2go application on your PC. Set up the new session with the following settings substituting the Login field <uxxxx> with your own assigned user name and the path to the RSA/DSA key for ssh connection. This is the same key referenced for MobaXterm connection that enables ssh devcloud.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/70007979-1943c100-1527-11ea-8cc0-685a5b50cfcb.png)



The input/output screen has a setting for the display size which can be adjusted depending on your screen size. Adjust the parameters on this panel to change to a different screen size. To determine what DPI to use for your monitor, type the following command in a MobaXterm terminal: 

```
xdpyinfo | grep dot
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/70003091-f8736f80-1516-11ea-9b36-666084afee51.png)


To launch the application, hit **OK** to save the settings and then click on the **New Session** icon to launch a graphics session.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69988900-6871fd80-14f7-11ea-8af1-dddc9c0adaad.png)

After a minute or so, you should see the X2GO screen, be patient. While waiting for X2GO to launch you will see a screen that looks like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69988847-4c6e5c00-14f7-11ea-8804-6394099a3b85.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/70008081-5314c780-1527-11ea-8c47-ad27b69222d7.png)

Click **Yes** when the following window pops up. 



You might get the following message if you previously logged into a different machine:

![host_key_verification_terminate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716812-b55b3500-f989-11e9-8c60-9c0eaaee2172.png)

Enter **No**.

![host_key_verification_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716830-bee49d00-f989-11e9-86b4-5aee8f792b5e.png)

Then another dialog box will appear, enter **Yes**,

You will see a window that looks like the following. If a window opens up, click **Default**.

![x2go_desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716843-c60bab00-f989-11e9-9d99-2fbbdcfce6d9.png)

If X2GO fails to launch, check that you ran the tunneling command on Mobaxterm on your local host. Click [here](#6.1-Opening-Port-for-Graphics-Usage-in-X2Go) to be redirected to the section regarding this tunneling command. 

In X2GO, right click within the desktop and select âOpen Terminal Hereâ.

![open_terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/67716892-dfacf280-f989-11e9-9d36-6e6c895c363e.png)

Your GUI ready environment should  be similar to the following image:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56968566/69988693-ff8a8580-14f6-11ea-8b38-16ab19094b37.png)

To change the font sizing of the Desktop files in **Desktop Settings** under the **Icons** tab. Select â**Use custom font size**â and change it to 5 or to your font size preference.

[Setup Devcloud Login Script Instructions](https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/blob/master/main/Public_Devcloud_Access_Instructions/LoginScript/README.md)

## 7.0 Quartus Access and Setup

From a terminal that is logged in to the devcloud, to get Quartus Access and Quartus Setup you can source the bash scripts manually.
For example by doing something like:
```
source /glob/development-tools/versions/intelFPGA_lite/18.1/init_quartus.sh 
```
or you can copy a bash script called devcloudLoginToolSetup.sh that is found in the folder LoginScripts and copy it into your devcloud then source that script by typing:
```
source devcloudLoginToolSetup.sh
```
Now to setup quartus run the tools_setup command that was just sourced from the devcloudLoginToolSetup.sh by typing:
```
tools_setup
```

This script has what you need to setup environment variables and paths to the Intel FPGA development tools.

Feel free to adjust your .bashrc and other associated scripts to source quartus_setup.sh inside those startup scripts. **Append the "```source ~/devcloudLoginToolSetup.sh```" command to the end of the .bashrc file.** 

Note if you want to run the acceleration stack or OpenCL tools, do not source quartus_setup.sh. Instead do the commands below manually on the appropriate compute node: n137-n139 for Arria 10, and n189 for Stratix 10.

For Arria 10 development stack: source /opt/a10/inteldevstack/init_env.sh

For Arria 10 runtime stack: source /opt/a10/intelrtestack/init_env.sh

For Stratix 10 development stack: source /opt/intel inteldevstack/init_env.sh

or instead of running the above commands manually, run:
```
tools_setup
```

## 8.0 Transferring Files to the Devcloud 

**There are three different ways to Transfer Files to the Devcloud:** 

1. [From a Local PC to DevCloud Server in X2Go Terminal (8.1)](#81-transferring-files-to-the-devcloud-with-scp)
2. [MobaXterm User Session (8.2)](#82-Using-MobaXterm-to-Transfer-Files)
3. [WinSCP Application (8.3)](#83-Using-WinSCP-to-Transfer-Files)

### 8.1 Transferring Files to the Devcloud with SCP 

Refer to the login instructions welcome page on file transfer to/from devcloud. **Use the local terminal on your PC to transfer files. Note: If on Intel firewall, replace devcloud with colfax-intel.**

Transferring Files from your localnode terminal. Your prompt on mobaxterm would be of the form: /home/mobaxterm (localnode)

```
scp /path/to/local/file devcloud:/path/to/remote/directory
```

From headnode or computenode to the localnode. 

```
scp devcloud:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

Here is an example:

```
scp /drives/c/User/username/Documents/file.txt devcloud:/home/u12345
```



### 8.2 Using MobaXterm to Transfer Files

## 9.0 Job Control on the X2GO Window

This section provides information on how to terminate jobs on the Devcloud. 

### 9.1 Searching for Free Nodes

You might need to terminate jobs on the Devcloud.  To see what nodes are tied up, from the headnode, type the following: 

```
psbnodes -s v-qsvr-fpga | grep -B 4 fpga
```

### 9.2 Submitting Jobs for a Specified Walltime

A user will be kicked off a node if they have been using it for longer than 6 hours. To submit a job with a specified walltime longer than 6 hours (for compilations longer than 6 hours). Nodes n130-n136 can increase walltime up to 24 hours and nodes n137-n139 and 189 can be increased up to a maximum of 48 hours. Type the following after qsub-ing into a specified node:

```
qsub -l walltime=<insert-time> 'command/bash file to be executed'
qsub -l walltime=12:00:00 walltime.sh		# example of a file to be executed
-------------------------------= walltime.sh ------------------------------
# begin walltime.sh
sleep 11h											# sleep command equivalent to a quartus compilation file requiring 11 hours of compilation
													# alternatively, sleep 11h would be quartus_sh commands (i.e. quartus_sh --flow main.v) 	
echo job success > ~/Documents/walltime_log.txt		# exit sleep at 11:00:00, output "job success" to walltime_log.txt
```

### 9.3 Report Status for Jobs Running on the Devcloud

To report the status of your jobs running on the DevCloud is to type the following:

```
qstat -s batch@v-qsvr-fpga
```

The result will be of the form:

`v-qsvr-fpga.aidevcloud:`
                                                                                  `Req'd       Req'd       Elap`
`Job ID                  Username    Queue    Jobname          SessID  NDS   TSK   Memory      Time    S   Time`

----------------------- ----------- -------- ---------------- ------ ----- ------ --------- --------- - ---------
`2390.v-qsvr-fpga.aidev  u27224      batch    STDIN             27907     1      2       --   06:00:00 R  01:15:02`



### 9.4 Deleting Jobs on the Devcloud

Jobs can be terminated with the following command when nodes are hanging with stalled jobs: 

```
qdel 2390.v-qsvr-fpga.aidevcloud
```

Note the suffix for the qstat command is .aidev however to kill the job with qdel you need to append .aidevcloud .

This is not recommended** but it is a another technique to delete a job from the headnode if a node is hanging. Type the following and look for the qsub commands:

```
ps -auxw 
```

Free up the node with the following command: 

```
kill <job-id>
```



## 10.0 Launching Quartus

The following command will launch the Quartus GUI: 

```
quartus &
```

The version you launch (Lite vs Pro) is dependent on the environment variables you set and sourced in the quartus_setup.sh script.

## 11.0 Launching the HLS compiler

If you specify HLS=:"TRUE" in the quartus_setup.sh setup script you will be able to access the HLS compiler, i++. The simplest test would be i++ hello_world.cpp. 

## 12.0 Launching the OpenCL compiler

If you specify OPENCL=:"TRUE" in the tool setup script you will be able to access the OpenCL compiler, aoc. (Needs update for acceleration stack and connectivity to A10 PAC card)

## 13.0 Communicating to the PAC card 

To list all SYSFS entries in a multi-PAC system (explain)

```
ls -l /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.?/device
```

To view serial number for a particular SYSFS entry (what does this mean)

```
hexdump -C /sys/class/fpga/intel-fpga-dev.2/intel-fpga-fme.2/intel-pac-hssi.?.auto/hssi_mgmt/eeprom
```

Note when running the Acceleration Stack Commands that communicate with the PAC Card, you will need python 2 in your search path. When initially creating your account, the /etc/skel/.bash_profile file is copied from the headnode to your account. This file specifies python3 first in the path. Switch your ~/.bash_profile to select python2 in your path within this file.

**Another method to see available cards:**

```
lspci | grep accel
```

View the various available cards and select a free one.

**To download a green bit stream (.gbs):*

```
fpgaconf -B 0x3b hello.gbs
```
